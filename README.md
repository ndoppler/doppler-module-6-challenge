# doppler-module-6-challenge

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to build a Weather Information Application. It featured writing code in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It's purpose was to utilize Javascript APIs to adjust the HTML and CSS based on user input. It focused on utilizing APIs from OpenWeather to gather the latitude and longitude of a city, as well as the current and forecasted weather. Our CSS was generated using the Bootstrap framework.  The needed functionality included a retrieving geographic information about a city and using that information as an input for the daily and forecast APIs. We had to generate the information by affecting the HTML and CSS using our JavaScript.

## Description
This Weather App allows users to search daily and upcoming forecasts of a city of their choosing.  The App also has the functionality to store previously searched cities in Local Storage, and render those previous queries as buttons. We also had to generate various HTML elements, including images based on the payload from the query.
